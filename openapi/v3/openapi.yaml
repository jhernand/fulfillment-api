        Note that the server doesn't make any guarantee about the delivery or order of these events. In particular events
        that happen while the client is disconnected will not be delivered. Clients should consider using other mechanisms
        to ensure that they process objects correctly. For example, they can combine this watch mechanism with periodic
        redconciliation of all the objects.

          The value of this parameter is a [CEL](https://cel.dev) boolean expression. The `event` variable will contain the
          fields of the event. If the result of the expression is `true` then the event will be sent by the server. For
          example, to receive only the events that indicate that a cluster order has been modified and is now in the
          fulfilled state:

          ```
          event.type == EVENT_TYPE_OBJECT_CREATED && event.cluster_order.status.state == CLUSTER_ORDER_STATE_FULFILLED
          ```

          If this isn't provided, or if the value is empty, then all the events that the user has permission to see will be
          sent by the server.

        In the HTTP+JSON version of the API this is mapped to the `PATCH` verb and the `update_mask` field is automatically
        populated from the list of fields present in the request body. For example, to update the `state` of an order to
        `FULFILLED` the request line should be like this:

        ```http
        PATCH /api/fulfillment/v1/cluster_orders/123
        ```

        And the request body should be like this:

        ```json
        {
          "status": {
            "state": "CLUSTER_ORDER_STATE_FULFILLED"
          }
        }
        ```

        The response body will contain the modified object.

        Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used for
        payload formats that can't be represented as JSON, such as raw binary or
        an HTML page.


        This message can be used both in streaming and non-streaming API methods in
        the request as well as the response.

        It can be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one
        wants to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the
        request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body.

        Example:

            message GetResourceRequest {
              // A unique request id.
              string request_id = 1;

              // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field.
              google.api.HttpBody http_body = 2;

            }

            service ResourceService {
              rpc GetResource(GetResourceRequest)
                returns (google.api.HttpBody);
              rpc UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody)
                returns (google.protobuf.Empty);

            }

        Example with streaming methods:

            service CaldavService {
              rpc GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
                returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);
              rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
                returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);

            }

        Use of this type only changes how the request and response bodies are
        handled, all other features will continue to work unchanged.
    protobufAny:
      type: object
      properties:
        '@type':
          type: string
          description: |-
            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
            the fully qualified name of the type (as in
            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
              value in binary format, or produce an error.
            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
              breaking changes.)

            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
            type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely used type server
            implementations and no plans to implement one.

            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
            used with implementation specific semantics.

        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any;
            any.PackFrom(foo);
            ...
            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
              ...
            }

        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
            ...
            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
            }
            // or ...
            if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
              foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
            }

         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

            foo = Foo(...)
            any = Any()
            any.Pack(foo)
            ...
            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
              any.Unpack(foo)
              ...

         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
             if err != nil {
               ...
             }
             ...
             foo := &pb.Foo{}
             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
               ...
             }

        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
        name "y.z".

        JSON
        ====
        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

            package google.profile;
            message Person {

          description: |-
            Contains a list of conditions that describe in detail the status of the order.

            For example, an order that failed could be represented like this (when converted to JSON):

               {
                 "id": "123",
                 "spec": {

                   "conditions": [
                     {
                       "type: "CLUSTER_ORDER_CONDITION_TYPE_ACCEPTED",
                       "status": "CONDITION_STATUS_TRUE",
                       "last_transition_time": "2025-03-12 20:15:59+00:00",
                       "message": "The order has been automatically approved"
                     },
                     {
                       "type": "CLUSTER_ORDER_CONDITION_TYPE_FULFILLED",
                       "status": "CONDITION_STATUS_FALSE",
                       "last_transition_time": "2025-03-12 20:17:16+00:00"
                     },
                     {
                       "type": "CLUSTER_ORDER_CONDITION_TYPE_FAILED",
                       "status": "CONDITION_STATUS_TRUE",
                       "last_transition_time": "2025-03-12 20:18:59+00:00",
                       "reason": "DnsProvisioningFailure",
                       "message": "Failed to create DNS domain 'example.com' because it already exists"
                     }
                   ]
                 }
               }

            In this example the `ACCEPTED` condition is true. That tells us that the order was accepted, and the details tell
            us that it was automatically approved.

            The `FUFILLED` condition isn't false. That means that order isn't fulfilled, without any other detail.

            The `FAILED` condition is true, so it is telling us that the fulfillment failed. It also gives additional detail
            in the with both a _reason_ intended for use by programs, and some some details to help humans understand and debug
            the issue.

            Note that in this example, to make it shorter, only three conditions appear. In general all the conditions (except
            `UNPSECIFIED`) will appear exactly once.

            Note also that this is just an example, in particular the `DnsProvisioningFailure` reason for the failed condition
            is imaginary. Check the documentation of the values of the `ClusterOrderConditionType` enumerated type to see
            possible values for the reason.

            This will be automatically set by the system when the cluster is initially created, according to the template

            The key of the map is the unique identifier of the node set for this cluster.

            For example, a cluster created with two different node sets, one for nodes without GPUs and another for nodes with
            GPUs could be represented like this:

            ```json
            {
              "id": "123",
              "spec": {

              "status": {
                "state": "CLUSTER_STATE_READY",
                "node_sets": {
                  "compute": {
                    "host_class": "acme_1tb",

                  },
                  "gpu": {
                    "host_class": "acme_1tb_h100",
                    "size": 3
                  }
                }
              }
            }
            ```

            The user will not be allowed to change the `host_class` field.

            The user will not be allowed to remove existing node sets, or add new node sets.

            The user will be allowed to update `size` field.

            If at any time the system can't allocate the number of nodes requested by the user, because of permissions, quota,
            availability of resources or system errors, the cluster will be marked as degraded, and the details will be in the
            `DEGRADED` condition.

        conditions:
          type: array
          description: |-
            Contains a list of conditions that describe in detail the status of the cluster.

            For example, an cluster that is ready could be represented like this (when converted to JSON):

               {
                 "id": "123",
                 "spec": {
                 },
                 "status": {
                   "state": "CLUSTER_STATE_READY",
                   "conditions": [
                     {
                       "type": "CLUSTER_CONDITION_TYPE_READY",
                       "status": "CONDITION_STATUS_TRUE",
                       "last_transition_time": "2025-03-12 20:15:59+00:00",
                       "message": "The cluster is ready to use",
                     },
                     {
                       "type": "CLUSTER_CONDITION_TYPE_FAILED",
                       "status": "CONDITION_STATUS_FALSE",
                       "last_transition_time": "2025-03-12 20:10:59+00:00"
                     }
                   ]
                 }
               }

            In this example the `READY` condition is true. That tells us that the cluster is ready to use via the API URL
            provided in the `status.api_url` field.

            The `FAILED` condition is false. That tells us that the cluster is *not* failed.

            Note that in this example, to make it shorter, only one condition appears. In general all the conditions (except
            `UNSPECIFIED`) will appear exactly once.

            Check the documentation of the values of the `ClusterConditionType` enumerated type to see possible conditions and
            reasons.
